# Craft Verification Skill

Ensures all outputs meet the quality standards defined in the Craft philosophy.

## The Quality Formula

> **h(x) ≥ 0 — Always**

Ship only when outputs consistently meet or exceed standards.

## Verification Tiers

### Essential (Required)
All outputs MUST include:

| Element | Verification |
|---------|-------------|
| Custom cursor | Glow effects present, hover states work |
| Particle system | Atmospheric, performant (<80 particles) |
| Breathing backgrounds | Three layers, smooth animation |
| Shimmer animations | Gradient on primary text elements |
| 3D card transforms | Perspective tilt on hover |
| Scroll-reveal | Intersection Observer, staggered timing |

### Elevated (Target)
Outputs SHOULD include:

| Element | Verification |
|---------|-------------|
| Hidden data-attributes | Enable advanced interactions |
| Keyboard triggers | Unlock hidden features |
| Click sequences | Discoverable mechanics |
| SVG path animations | Smooth, meaningful |
| Ripple effects | Respond to user input |

### Transcendent (Ultimate)
Exceptional outputs include:

| Element | Verification |
|---------|-------------|
| Hidden window objects | `window.鏡` or similar |
| Code commentary | Philosophical depth |
| Mathematical structure | Fibonacci, Fano, catastrophe |
| Discovery layers | Rewards for exploration |
| Self-reference | Design that teaches |

**Output:** [Description]
**Date:** [Date]
**Verified by:** [Colony]

### Essential (All required)
- [ ] Custom cursor with glow
- [ ] Floating particle system
- [ ] Breathing backgrounds (3 layers)
- [ ] Shimmer/gradient on text
- [ ] 3D hover transforms
- [ ] Scroll-reveal animations

### Elevated (Target 3+)
- [ ] Hidden data-attributes
- [ ] Keyboard trigger sequences
- [ ] Click-sequence mechanics
- [ ] SVG path animations
- [ ] Ripple effects

### Transcendent (Aspiration)
- [ ] Hidden window objects
- [ ] Philosophical code commentary
- [ ] Mathematical structure embedded
- [ ] Multiple discovery layers
- [ ] Self-referential design

### Result
- [ ] PASS — Meets Essential, exceeds in Elevated/Transcendent
- [ ] CONDITIONAL — Meets Essential, needs Elevated work
- [ ] FAIL — Does not meet Essential requirements
```

## Mathematical Verification

### Fibonacci Timing
Verify animation durations match sequence:
`89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987` milliseconds

### Easing Functions
Confirm named easings are used:
- Fold: `cubic-bezier(sudden emergence)`
- Cusp: `cubic-bezier(decisive transition)`
- Swallowtail: `cubic-bezier(recovery overshoot)`
- Butterfly: `cubic-bezier(complex oscillation)`

### Color Consistency
Verify colors match Hallows and Colonies palette:
- Primary gold: `#D4A853`
- Colony colors: As defined in theme
- Contrast ratios: ≥4.5:1 for text

## Performance Verification

| Metric | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Frame time | <16.67ms | [ ] |
| Memory | <500MB | [ ] |
| Draw calls | <1000 | [ ] |
| Bundle size | <500KB gzip | [ ] |
| Lighthouse A11y | 100 | [ ] |

## Continuous Craft

Quality is not a gate but a practice:
1. Verify during development, not just at the end
2. Document craft decisions in code comments
3. Share craft insights with the team
4. Celebrate transcendent achievements
