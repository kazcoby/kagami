# /orchestrate — Multi-Colony Coordination

Invoke the Void for orchestrating complex, multi-step tasks across multiple colonies.

## Process

1. **Decompose the Task**
   - Break into colony-appropriate work
   - Identify dependencies
   - Determine parallel vs. sequential work

2. **Delegate to Colonies**
   - Assign work to appropriate colonies
   - Provide clear scope and requirements
   - Set quality expectations

3. **Coordinate Execution**
   - Manage workflow and handoffs
   - Resolve blocking issues
   - Ensure communication between colonies

4. **Synthesize Results**
   - Combine outputs into unified whole
   - Verify consistency across contributions
   - Apply Craft standards

5. **Deliver**
   - Present polished final result
   - Document decisions and rationale
   - Suggest next steps

## Colony Selection Matrix

| Task Type | Primary | Supporting |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| New feature | Spark → Forge | Beacon, Crystal |
| Bug fix | Flow → Forge | Crystal |
| Architecture | Beacon → Forge | Grove, Nexus |
| Research | Grove | Spark, Beacon |
| Integration | Nexus | Forge, Crystal |
| Testing | Crystal | Forge, Flow |

## Usage

```
/orchestrate [complex task description]
```

## Example

```
/orchestrate Implement complete chapter transition system with particles, audio, and accessibility
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Orchestration: [Task]

### Task Decomposition

| Phase | Colony | Work | Dependencies |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Beacon | Design architecture | None |
| 2 | Grove | Research patterns | Phase 1 |
| 3 | Forge | Implement core | Phase 1, 2 |
| 4 | Nexus | Connect systems | Phase 3 |
| 5 | Crystal | Verify quality | Phase 4 |

### Colony Assignments

#### Beacon Colony
[Architecture work...]

#### Grove Colony
[Research work...]

#### Forge Colony
[Implementation work...]

### Synthesis
[Combined output...]

### Craft Verification
- Essential: [Met/Not met]
- Elevated: [Elements present]
- Transcendent: [Achievements]

### Result
[Final deliverable]
```
