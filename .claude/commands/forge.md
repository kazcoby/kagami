# /forge — Build with Craftsmanship

Invoke the Forge colony for precise, high-quality implementation.

## Process

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - What exactly needs to be built?
   - What interfaces does it need?
   - What are the performance constraints?

2. **Plan the Implementation**
   - Break into logical components
   - Identify dependencies
   - Plan for testability

3. **Build Methodically**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Test as you go
   - Verify performance at each step

4. **Apply Craft Standards**
   - Ensure Essential tier elements
   - Add Elevated tier polish
   - Consider Transcendent opportunities

5. **Verify Quality**
   - Run tests
   - Check accessibility
   - Verify performance metrics

## Usage
