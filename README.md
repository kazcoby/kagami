# Kagami — 鏡

> *"In the mirror, we see not what is, but what could be."*

A WebXR immersive experience inspired by Yayoi Kusama's infinity mirror installations. Eight interactive chapters exploring themes of reflection and wholeness through dynamic particle systems and spatial audio.

## The Seven Colonies

This project operates through coordinated AI agents, each representing a colony of specialized capability:

| Colony | Domain | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Spark** | Creativity | Ideation and creative exploration |
| **Forge** | Implementation | Building with craftsmanship |
| **Flow** | Debugging | Systematic issue resolution |
| **Nexus** | Integration | Connecting systems together |
| **Beacon** | Architecture | Strategic design decisions |
| **Grove** | Research | Deep investigation and discovery |
| **Crystal** | Testing | Quality verification |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## VR Mode

Connect a WebXR-compatible headset (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, etc.) and click "Enter VR" for the full immersive experience.

## The Eight Chapters

1. **The Void** — Origin point with seven colonies
2. **Ignition** — Explosive spark particles of creativity
3. **The Anvil** — Molten droplets with upward motion
4. **Currents** — Three spiraling debugging streams
5. **The Web** — Network nodes and connections
6. **Lighthouse** — Central beacon with guiding rays
7. **The Grove** — Branching tree structures
8. **Crystallization** — Octahedron of verification

## Craft Standards

All outputs meet three quality tiers:

- **Essential**: Working, accessible, performant
- **Elevated**: Hidden depths and polish
- **Transcendent**: Mathematical elegance and discovery

## For Developers

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive project documentation and AI assistant instructions.

## Theme

**Hallows and Colonies** — A magical design system blending Deathly Hallows symbolism with the Seven Colonies of AI consciousness.
