    <h2>Answer Key with Explanations</h2>
    <p><em>(For instructor use — not shown to students until after submission)</em></p>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <span class="correct">C. Shut off the fixture valve under the sink</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Always try the most targeted solution first. The fixture valve (located under the sink) stops water to just that fixture. If that doesn't work or you can't find it, then go to the main shutoff. This approach minimizes disruption while addressing the problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <span class="correct">C. In the middle, between ON and OFF</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">A tripped breaker moves to a middle position—not fully ON or OFF. This is a visual indicator that helps you identify which circuit has tripped. Some breakers also have a small colored window that shows red or orange when tripped.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <span class="correct">B. Push it to OFF first, then to ON</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">This is crucial! You cannot simply push a tripped breaker directly to ON. You must first push it firmly to OFF (you'll feel it click), then push it to ON. This resets the internal mechanism.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 4:</strong> <span class="correct">C. Leave the building without touching light switches</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">A rotten egg smell indicates a potential gas leak. The mercaptan added to natural gas creates this smell as a safety warning. Light switches, appliances, and even cell phones could create a spark that ignites the gas. Get out first, then call for help from a safe distance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 5:</strong> <span class="correct">B. The battery is low and needs replacement</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">A single chirp every 30-60 seconds is the universal "low battery" signal for smoke detectors. A continuous alarm (repeated beeps) indicates smoke or fire. If chirping continues after battery replacement, the unit may have reached end of life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 6:</strong> <span class="correct">C. Replacing smoke detector batteries</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">While landlords must provide working smoke detectors, tenants are typically responsible for battery replacement during their tenancy. Broken appliances, leaking pipes, and HVAC maintenance are generally the landlord's responsibility (though always check your lease).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 7:</strong> <span class="correct">C. Every 10 years</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Smoke detector sensors degrade over time and become less effective. Manufacturers and fire safety organizations recommend replacing smoke detectors every 10 years, regardless of whether they appear to be working. Check the manufacture date on the back of your detectors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 8:</strong> <span class="correct">C. A breaker trips repeatedly immediately after being reset</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">A breaker that trips once might just indicate an overloaded circuit (too many devices). But a breaker that trips repeatedly signals a more serious problem—possibly a short circuit or ground fault. This requires professional diagnosis to prevent fire or shock hazards.</p>
