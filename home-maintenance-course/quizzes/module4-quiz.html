    <h2>Answer Key with Explanations</h2>
    <p><em>(For instructor use — not shown to students until after submission)</em></p>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <span class="correct">B. Phillips head screwdriver</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Phillips head screwdrivers have a + shaped tip designed to fit into Phillips screws (the most common type). Flathead screwdrivers have a - shaped tip for slotted screws. Allen keys (hex wrenches) are for hexagonal socket screws. Adjustable wrenches are for nuts and bolts, not screws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <span class="correct">B. Spackle applied with finger or putty knife</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">For tiny holes under 1/4 inch (like nail holes), a simple application of spackle is sufficient. Just fill the hole, let it dry, sand lightly if needed, and touch up with paint. Mesh patches and patch kits are for larger holes (1 inch and up).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <span class="correct">B. 100% silicone or mold-resistant silicone</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">For wet areas like bathtubs and showers, 100% silicone caulk is best because it's completely waterproof, flexible, and resists mold growth. Mold-resistant versions contain additives that further prevent mildew. Acrylic latex is easier to apply but less water-resistant and better suited for interior trim work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 4:</strong> <span class="correct">B. Apply lubricant (WD-40, silicone spray, or similar)</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Squeaky hinges are usually caused by metal-on-metal friction from dried lubricant or dust. Simply applying lubricant to the hinge pins and joints usually solves the problem in seconds. Replacing hinges or removing doors is unnecessary for a simple squeak.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 5:</strong> <span class="correct">B. Insert toothpicks with wood glue, then reinstall the screw</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">When a screw hole is stripped, the screw has nothing to grip. Inserting wooden toothpicks (with optional wood glue) fills the hole with new material for the screw to bite into. Break off the toothpicks flush with the surface, and the screw will hold securely again. For even more holding power, use longer screws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 6:</strong> <span class="correct">C. Monthly</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends testing smoke and CO detectors monthly by pressing the test button. Batteries should be replaced at least once a year (many people do this when daylight saving time changes). The detectors themselves should be replaced every 10 years.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 7:</strong> <span class="correct">B. It creates a documented record of the request</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Written requests (especially email) create a paper trail documenting when you reported the issue and what the landlord's response was. This documentation is essential if problems persist, if there's a dispute, or if you need to pursue legal remedies. Always follow up phone calls with a written summary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
      <p><strong>Question 8:</strong> <span class="correct">B. Asking for 100% payment upfront</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Reputable contractors never ask for full payment before work is completed. A typical payment structure is 1/3 deposit to start, 1/3 at midpoint, and 1/3 upon completion. Demanding full payment upfront is a major red flag for potential scams. Written estimates, partial deposits, and proper licensing are all signs of legitimate contractors.</p>
