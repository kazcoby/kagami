    <p><strong>Points:</strong> 30</p>
    <p><strong>Due:</strong> End of Week 4</p>
    <p><strong>Submission:</strong> PDF, Word document, screenshot of digital calendar, or typed directly into Canvas</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This capstone assignment brings together everything you've learned in the course. You'll create a personalized maintenance calendar for YOUR specific home, accounting for whether you rent or own, your climate, and your home's unique features.</p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <div class="task-box">
    <h3>Part 1: Home Profile (5 points)</h3>
    <p>Create a brief profile of your home:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Housing type:</strong> Apartment, condo, townhouse, single-family home?</li>
      <li><strong>Renter or homeowner?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Approximate age of home:</strong> (estimate if unsure)</li>
      <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Hot/cold extremes? High humidity? Freeze risk?</li>
      <li><strong>Heating/cooling type:</strong> Central HVAC, window units, baseboard, etc.?</li>
      <li><strong>Special features:</strong> Fireplace? Pool? Septic? Well water? Older appliances?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This profile helps explain why your calendar includes (or excludes) certain tasks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task-box">
    <h3>Part 2: Monthly Task List (8 points)</h3>
    <p>Create your personalized monthly checklist. Include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 5 monthly tasks appropriate for YOUR home</li>
      <li>Brief notes on each task (what specifically you'll check/do)</li>
      <li>Indicate any tasks that are N/A and explain why</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example format:</strong></p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Task</th>
        <th>My Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Check HVAC filter</td>
        <td>Filter location: hallway closet. Current filter size: 20x25x1. Replace every 30 days during summer (high pollen).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Test smoke detectors</td>
        <td>3 detectors: hallway, bedroom, kitchen. Press test button on each.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <div class="task-box">
    <h3>Part 3: Seasonal Calendar (10 points)</h3>
    <p>Create a year-at-a-glance calendar showing seasonal tasks. This can be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A table with columns for Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter</li>
      <li>A screenshot of recurring calendar events you've set up</li>
      <li>A filled-out version of our course template</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 3-5 tasks per season</li>
      <li>Tasks must be appropriate for YOUR specific situation (renter vs. owner, climate)</li>
      <li>Include at least 2 annual professional services if you're a homeowner</li>
      <li>Note any tasks you'll skip and why (e.g., "N/A - no fireplace")</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="task-box">
    <h3>Part 4: Emergency Contact List (4 points)</h3>
    <p>Create or screenshot your emergency contact list including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 3 professional contacts (plumber, electrician, HVAC, handyman, etc.)</li>
      <li>For renters: Landlord/property manager contact info, maintenance request procedure</li>
      <li>Utility company emergency numbers</li>
      <li>Note how you found/verified these contacts</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>If you haven't found all contacts yet, list the services you need to research and your plan for finding them.</em></p>
  </div>

  <div class="task-box">
    <h3>Part 5: Reflection (3 points)</h3>
    <p>Write a brief reflection (100-150 words) addressing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What's one thing about home maintenance you didn't know before this course?</li>
      <li>What's the most important maintenance task for YOUR specific home?</li>
      <li>How confident do you feel about tackling basic home maintenance now compared to before the course?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Submission Format</h2>
  <p>Your submission should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name and date</li>
    <li>Clearly labeled sections for each part</li>
    <li>Tables, lists, or calendar screenshots as appropriate</li>
    <li>The reflection paragraph at the end</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tips">
    <strong>Tips for Success</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Reference the seasonal task lists in Page 5 as a starting point</li>
      <li>Customize! Don't just copy the course lists—tailor them to YOUR home</li>
      <li>If you're a renter, focus on tasks that are YOUR responsibility</li>
      <li>Consider your climate (no winterizing for Miami, no A/C prep for Minnesota winters)</li>
      <li>Screenshots of digital calendars are perfectly acceptable</li>
      <li>The more specific your notes, the more useful your calendar will be</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Common Mistakes to Avoid</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Copying the course lists without customization</li>
      <li>Including tasks that don't apply (e.g., gutter cleaning for apartment renters)</li>
      <li>Forgetting to explain WHY certain tasks don't apply</li>
      <li>Missing the reflection section</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
