  <h1>Assignment: Home Systems Photo Documentation</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This hands-on assignment asks you to physically explore your home and document the location of critical systems. You'll create a reference that could be life-saving in an emergency and helpful for anyone who might need to assist you (house sitter, family member, etc.).</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Time Required:</strong> 30-60 minutes to explore and document, plus time to compile your submission.
  </div>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Part 1: Photo Documentation (60 points)</h3>
  <p>Locate and photograph the following items in your home. For each photo, include a brief caption explaining what it is and exactly where it's located.</p>

  <p><strong>Required photos (10 points each):</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Main water shutoff valve</strong> — Include its location (e.g., "Basement, east wall near water heater")</li>
    <li><strong>Electrical panel</strong> — Show the panel door closed AND open (can be two photos)</li>
    <li><strong>One smoke detector</strong> — Note which room and if you tested it</li>
    <li><strong>One CO detector</strong> (or combo unit) — Note location</li>
    <li><strong>Water heater</strong> — Show the unit and its shutoff valve</li>
    <li><strong>HVAC filter location</strong> — Show where the filter goes (furnace or return vent)</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Can't Find Something?</strong> That's actually important data! If you can't locate an item, write a brief explanation of where you looked and what your next steps are (ask landlord, schedule inspection, etc.).
  </div>

  <h3>Part 2: Home Systems Checklist (20 points)</h3>
  <p>Download and complete the <strong>Home Systems Checklist</strong> from the Resources module. Fill in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Locations of all shutoffs and systems</li>
    <li>Emergency contact numbers (utilities, landlord if applicable)</li>
    <li>Any issues or concerns you noticed</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Upload the completed checklist with your submission.</p>

  <h3>Part 3: Reflection (20 points)</h3>
  <p>Write a brief reflection (100-150 words) addressing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What was easiest to find? What was most challenging?</li>
    <li>Did you discover any potential safety concerns? How will you address them?</li>
    <li>How has this exercise changed your awareness of your home?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Submit all photos in a single document (PDF, Word) OR as a collection of image files</li>
    <li>Include captions/labels for each photo</li>
    <li>Attach your completed Home Systems Checklist</li>
    <li>Include your written reflection</li>
  </ul>
