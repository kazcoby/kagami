  <h1>Page 1: HVAC Basics</h1>

  <p>HVAC stands for <strong>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning</strong>—the systems that keep your home comfortable year-round. Understanding the basics helps you maintain the system, communicate with technicians, and know when something's wrong.</p>

  <h2>Common HVAC System Types</h2>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>Central Forced Air (Most Common)</h3>
    <p>A furnace or air handler pushes heated or cooled air through ducts to vents throughout your home. Uses a filter to clean the air.</p>
    <p><strong>Key components:</strong> Furnace/air handler, ducts, vents, thermostat, outdoor AC unit (if applicable)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>Heat Pump</h3>
    <p>Works like an air conditioner but can reverse to provide heat. Very efficient in moderate climates. Has an outdoor unit and indoor air handler.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>Mini-Split / Ductless</h3>
    <p>Wall-mounted indoor units connected to an outdoor compressor. No ducts needed. Common in apartments and additions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>Baseboard / Radiator Heat</h3>
    <p>Electric baseboards or hot water radiators. No filter to change, but keep them clear of furniture and drapes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>Window Units</h3>
    <p>Self-contained AC units in windows. Have their own filters that need regular cleaning.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>The Air Flow Path</h2>
  <p>Understanding how air moves through your home helps you maintain the system:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Return vents</strong> pull air from your rooms (usually larger vents, often on walls or ceilings)</li>
    <li>Air passes through the <strong>filter</strong> (this is what you change!)</li>
    <li>The <strong>furnace/air handler</strong> heats or cools the air</li>
    <li>A <strong>blower fan</strong> pushes air through ducts</li>
    <li><strong>Supply vents</strong> deliver conditioned air to rooms (smaller vents)</li>
    <li>Cycle repeats</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Why Airflow Matters:</strong> Blocked vents, dirty filters, or closed doors can restrict airflow, making your system work harder, cost more, and wear out faster. Keep vents open and unobstructed!
  </div>

  <h2>What You Can Do vs. What Needs a Pro</h2>

        <td>Keep vents open and unblocked</td>
        <td>Unusual smells (burning, musty)</td>

        <td>Replace thermostat batteries</td>
        <td>Ice on outdoor unit or lines</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Reset the system (breaker/switch)</td>
        <td>Short cycling (turning on/off rapidly)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Stop and Call a Pro If...</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You smell gas near your furnace (leave and call gas company)</li>
      <li>The system makes loud banging, screeching, or grinding sounds</li>
      <li>You see water pooling around the indoor unit</li>
      <li>The system runs constantly but doesn't reach temperature</li>
      <li>You notice a burning smell when the system runs</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Seasonal Considerations</h2>

  <h3>Before Cooling Season (Spring)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Change the filter</li>
    <li>Clear debris from around the outdoor unit (2 feet clearance)</li>
    <li>Test the AC—run it before the first hot day to catch problems</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Before Heating Season (Fall)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Change the filter</li>
    <li>Test the heat—run it before cold weather arrives</li>
    <li>Schedule professional maintenance if due</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="renter-note">
    <strong>RENTERS:</strong> Your landlord is responsible for HVAC repairs and typically annual maintenance. However, filter changes may be your responsibility—check your lease. If your filter location is unclear, ask your landlord to show you.
  </div>

  <div class="homeowner-note">
    <strong>HOMEOWNERS:</strong> Schedule professional HVAC maintenance annually (ideally spring for AC, fall for heating). Many companies offer service plans that include priority scheduling and discounts on repairs.
  </div>

  <h2>Action Items</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify what type of HVAC system you have</li>
    <li>Locate your return vents (where the filter likely is)</li>
    <li>Find the OFF switch or breaker for your system (in case of emergency)</li>
    <li>Check when your system was last professionally serviced (ask landlord or check records)</li>
  </ol>
