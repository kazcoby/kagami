  <h1>Page 2: Understanding Your Electrical Panel</h1>

  <p>Your electrical panel (also called a breaker box or fuse box) is the control center for all electricity in your home. Understanding it helps you restore power quickly when a circuit trips—and know when to step back and call an electrician.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>SAFETY FIRST: What You Should NEVER Do</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Never touch wires inside the panel</li>
      <li>Never remove the panel cover (the inner "dead front")</li>
      <li>Never work on the panel if the floor is wet</li>
      <li>Never reset a breaker that keeps tripping repeatedly</li>
      <li>Never use a panel that shows burn marks, smells burnt, or makes buzzing sounds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your job is to reset breakers—nothing more. Everything else is for licensed electricians.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Finding Your Electrical Panel</h2>
  <p>Common locations include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basement or utility room</li>
    <li>Garage</li>
    <li>Hallway closet</li>
    <li>Laundry room</li>
    <li>Outside the home (in a weatherproof box)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="renter-note">
    <strong>RENTERS:</strong> In apartment buildings, your panel might be inside your unit (often in a closet) or in a shared utility room. If it's in a locked common area, know how to get access in an emergency.
  </div>

  <h2>Parts of Your Panel</h2>

  <h3>Main Breaker</h3>
  <p>Usually at the top, this large switch (often labeled 100, 150, or 200 amps) controls power to your entire home. Flip it to "OFF" to cut all electricity—useful in emergencies like flooding or fire.</p>

  <h3>Individual Circuit Breakers</h3>
  <p>The rows of switches below the main breaker. Each controls power to a specific area or circuit: "Kitchen," "Master Bedroom," "Bathroom GFCI," etc.</p>

  <h3>Breaker Positions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ON:</strong> Switch is pushed toward the center/labels</li>
    <li><strong>OFF:</strong> Switch is pushed toward the outside edge</li>
    <li><strong>TRIPPED:</strong> Switch is in the middle position (not fully ON or OFF)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Reset a Tripped Breaker</h2>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">1</span><strong>Identify the tripped breaker.</strong> Look for a switch in the middle position or one that looks different from the others. Some breakers have a small window that shows red or orange when tripped.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">2</span><strong>Turn off and unplug devices on that circuit.</strong> This prevents an immediate re-trip.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">3</span><strong>Push the breaker firmly to OFF first.</strong> You must go to OFF before going to ON.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">4</span><strong>Push firmly to ON.</strong> You should feel a click.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">5</span><strong>Test the circuit.</strong> Turn on a light or plug something in to confirm power is restored.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">6</span><strong>Reconnect devices one at a time.</strong> This helps identify if one device is causing the problem.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why Breakers Trip</h2>

  <h3>Overloaded Circuit</h3>
  <p>Too many devices drawing power at once. Common culprits: space heaters, hair dryers, window AC units, multiple kitchen appliances.</p>
  <p><em>Solution: Spread high-power devices across different circuits.</em></p>

  <h3>Short Circuit</h3>
  <p>A wiring problem or damaged cord creating an unintended path. Often accompanied by a burning smell or visible damage.</p>
  <p><em>Solution: Inspect cords for damage. If no obvious cause, call an electrician.</em></p>

  <h3>Ground Fault</h3>
  <p>Electricity escaping to ground, often due to moisture. GFCI outlets and breakers are designed to detect this.</p>
  <p><em>Solution: Check for water intrusion. Reset the GFCI.</em></p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Stop and Call a Pro If...</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A breaker trips immediately after resetting (same circuit, repeatedly)</li>
      <li>You smell burning or see scorch marks</li>
      <li>The panel is warm to the touch</li>
      <li>You hear buzzing or crackling from the panel</li>
      <li>Multiple breakers trip at once (not during a storm)</li>
      <li>You have a fuse box and don't know how to replace fuses</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Creating a Circuit Map</h2>
  <p>If your panel isn't labeled (or labels are wrong), creating a circuit map is a great weekend project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Get a partner—one at the panel, one walking through the house</li>
    <li>Turn off one breaker at a time</li>
    <li>Have your partner check which outlets, lights, and switches lost power</li>
    <li>Label the breaker with a marker or label maker</li>
    <li>Repeat for all breakers</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Action Item:</strong> Locate your electrical panel and take a photo. Can you identify the main breaker? Are the circuits labeled? Note any that are blank or unclear.
  </div>

  <div class="homeowner-note">
    <strong>HOMEOWNERS:</strong> Consider having an electrician inspect panels over 25 years old, especially Federal Pacific, Zinsco, or fuse boxes. These may have safety issues and could affect insurance.
