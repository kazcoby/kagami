  <h1>Page 3: Gas Safety Basics</h1>

  <div class="danger">
    <strong>CRITICAL SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
    <p>Natural gas and propane are valuable energy sources, but they require respect. Gas leaks can cause explosions, fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. This page teaches you to IDENTIFY and RESPOND to gas emergencies—never to repair or modify gas systems yourself.</p>
    <p><strong>ALL gas work must be performed by licensed professionals.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <h2>Do You Have Gas Appliances?</h2>
  <p>Not every home uses natural gas or propane. Common gas-powered appliances include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Furnace or boiler</li>
    <li>Water heater</li>
    <li>Stove/range/cooktop</li>
    <li>Clothes dryer</li>
    <li>Fireplace or gas logs</li>
    <li>Outdoor grill (propane)</li>
    <li>Pool or spa heater</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>All-Electric Home?</strong> If all your appliances are electric, you can skim this page for general knowledge. You still need carbon monoxide detectors (cars in attached garages can produce CO), but gas leak procedures won't apply to your daily life.
  </div>

  <h2>Recognizing a Gas Leak</h2>

  <h3>The Signs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Natural gas is odorless, but utility companies add mercaptan—a chemical that smells like rotten eggs or sulfur. If you smell it, take it seriously.</li>
    <li><strong>Sound:</strong> A hissing or roaring sound near gas lines or appliances</li>
    <li><strong>Sight:</strong> Dead or dying vegetation in an otherwise healthy area (outdoor leak), bubbles in standing water, dust blowing from the ground</li>
    <li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Dizziness, nausea, headaches, difficulty breathing when in the home but feeling better outside</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If You Suspect a Gas Leak</h2>

  <div class="step-box">
    <h3>Immediate Actions (Do These NOW)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Don't create sparks or flames.</strong> No light switches, no appliances, no matches, no cigarettes.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't use your phone inside.</strong> Walk outside first.</li>
      <li><strong>Leave the door open.</strong> Allow gas to ventilate as you exit.</li>
      <li><strong>Get everyone out.</strong> People and pets, immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Go to a safe distance.</strong> At least 100 feet from the building.</li>
      <li><strong>Call 911 or your gas company's emergency line.</strong></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p class="important-number">Your gas company's 24/7 emergency line: _________________ (fill this in!)</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>NEVER DO THESE DURING A GAS LEAK:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Flip any light switches (on OR off)</li>
      <li>Use your cell phone inside the building</li>
      <li>Start your car in the garage</li>
      <li>Try to find or fix the leak yourself</li>
      <li>Re-enter the building until cleared by professionals</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Know Your Gas Shutoff (But Don't Touch It)</h2>

  <p>Your home has a main gas shutoff valve, typically located:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Near the gas meter (outside)</li>
    <li>Where the gas line enters the building</li>
    <li>Near the water heater or furnace (interior shutoff)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The valve is usually a lever or a rectangular fitting that requires a wrench to turn.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Important:</strong> While it's good to know where your gas shutoff is, you should generally NOT attempt to shut it off during a leak unless specifically instructed by emergency responders. Why?
    <ul>
      <li>Operating the valve could create a spark</li>
      <li>Once gas is shut off, it must be professionally restored</li>
      <li>Every pilot light in your home will need to be relit by a professional</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your job is to GET OUT and CALL FOR HELP.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Preventing Gas Problems</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Annual inspections:</strong> Have gas appliances professionally inspected yearly</li>
    <li><strong>Clear the area:</strong> Keep flammable materials away from gas appliances</li>
    <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Ensure gas appliances have proper ventilation</li>
    <li><strong>CO detectors:</strong> Install and maintain carbon monoxide detectors on every floor</li>
    <li><strong>Blue flames:</strong> Gas burners should burn blue, not yellow or orange (yellow indicates incomplete combustion)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="renter-note">
    <strong>RENTERS:</strong> Gas safety inspections are your landlord's responsibility. However, you should:
    <ul>
      <li>Know where the gas shutoff is located</li>
      <li>Report any gas smell immediately (call gas company first, then landlord)</li>
      <li>Ensure your unit has working CO detectors (required by law in most states)</li>
      <li>Never use gas stoves or ovens for heating your apartment</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Action Items</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Determine if you have gas appliances in your home</li>
    <li>Find and save your gas company's emergency number</li>
    <li>Locate (but don't touch) your gas shutoff valve</li>
    <li>Verify you have working carbon monoxide detectors</li>
  </ol>
