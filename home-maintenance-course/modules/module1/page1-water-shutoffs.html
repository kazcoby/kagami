  <h1>Page 1: Know Your Water Shutoffs</h1>

  <p>Water damage is one of the most common—and expensive—home emergencies. A burst pipe, failed water heater, or broken supply line can cause thousands of dollars in damage in minutes. Knowing how to quickly shut off your water can be the difference between a minor inconvenience and a major disaster.</p>

  <h2>Three Levels of Water Shutoffs</h2>
  <p>Every home has multiple points where you can stop water flow. Understanding all three levels gives you options depending on the situation.</p>

  <h3>1. Fixture Shutoffs (Individual)</h3>
  <p>These small valves control water to a single fixture—a toilet, sink, or appliance.</p>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><strong>Where to find them:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Toilets:</strong> Look behind or beside the toilet, near the floor. There's usually an oval-shaped valve on the wall.</li>
      <li><strong>Sinks:</strong> Open the cabinet below. You'll typically see two valves—one for hot (left) and one for cold (right).</li>
      <li><strong>Washing machine:</strong> Behind the machine, usually two valves (hot and cold) coming out of the wall.</li>
      <li><strong>Dishwasher:</strong> Usually under the kitchen sink.</li>
      <li><strong>Water heater:</strong> On the cold water pipe entering the top of the tank.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p><strong>To shut off:</strong> Turn the valve clockwise (righty-tighty) until it stops. Most are gate valves (round handles) or ball valves (lever handles).</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Test Them Now!</strong> Go find the shutoff valves under your bathroom sink. Turn them off, then try the faucet—no water should come out. Turn them back on. This simple test confirms they work.
  </div>

  <h3>2. Whole-House Shutoff</h3>
  <p>This single valve stops ALL water coming into your home. Use it for major leaks or when you can't identify which fixture is the problem.</p>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><strong>Common locations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Near the water heater</li>
      <li>In the basement or crawl space where the water line enters</li>
      <li>In a utility closet</li>
      <li>Near the front of the house (inside) where the main line comes in</li>
      <li>In the garage</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="renter-note">
    <strong>RENTERS:</strong> If you can't find your main shutoff, ask your landlord or property manager. In some apartments, the shutoff may be in a locked utility room—know who to call for emergency access!
  </div>

  <h3>3. Street/Meter Shutoff</h3>
  <p>Located at the water meter, usually near the street or sidewalk in a covered box. This is the "nuclear option" that shuts off water before it even enters your property.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Stop and Call a Pro If...</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Your street shutoff is stuck, rusted, or won't turn</li>
      <li>The meter box is flooded or full of debris</li>
      <li>You're not sure which meter is yours (multi-unit buildings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many water utilities will send someone to shut off water in emergencies—save their number!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="homeowner-note">
    <strong>HOMEOWNERS:</strong> You may need a special "meter key" tool (about $10 at hardware stores) to operate the street shutoff. Consider buying one and keeping it accessible. Some municipalities require you to call them to operate the street valve.
  </div>

  <h2>How to Shut Off Water: Step by Step</h2>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">1</span><strong>Don't panic.</strong> Even a significant leak gives you a few minutes to act.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">2</span><strong>Identify the source.</strong> Can you see where the water is coming from?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">3</span><strong>Try the fixture valve first.</strong> If water is coming from a specific fixture, shut off that valve.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">4</span><strong>If that doesn't work, go to the main.</strong> Shut off the whole-house valve.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">5</span><strong>Open a faucet.</strong> After shutting off water, open a faucet on a lower floor to relieve pressure and drain remaining water from pipes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">6</span><strong>Address the immediate damage.</strong> Put towels down, move valuables, take photos for insurance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step-box">
    <p><span class="step-number">7</span><strong>Call for help.</strong> Contact a plumber, your landlord, or your insurance company as needed.</p>
  </div>
