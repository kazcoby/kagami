  <h1>Discussion: Your Biggest Energy User</h1>

  <div class="discussion-prompt">
    <h2>Discussion Prompt</h2>
    <p>This week we explored HVAC, appliances, and energy efficiency. Now let's share what we learned about our own homes!</p>

    <p><strong>In your initial post, address the following:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Filter findings:</strong> Where is your HVAC filter located? What size is it? Was it dirtier than you expected?</li>
      <li><strong>Appliance age check:</strong> How old are your major appliances (fridge, washer, dryer)? Any that might be energy hogs?</li>
      <li><strong>One change you'll make:</strong> Based on this week's content, what's one efficiency improvement you plan to implement?</li>
      <li><strong>Share a tip:</strong> Did you learn something not covered in the lessons? Found a helpful YouTube video? Share it with the class!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="requirements">
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial post:</strong> 150-250 words, due by Day 4</li>
      <li><strong>Replies:</strong> Respond meaningfully to at least 2 classmates, due by Day 7</li>
      <li><strong>Meaningful replies</strong> share your own experience, suggest additional tips, or ask follow-up questions</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Discussion Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be specific about your findings—dimensions, ages, conditions</li>
    <li>If you discovered a problem (like a very old appliance), share your plan to address it</li>
    <li>Feel free to share photos of particularly dirty filters (we've all been there!)</li>
    <li>Regional tips are welcome—what works in Arizona may differ from Minnesota</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial post (60%):</strong> Addresses all prompts, demonstrates engagement with your own home</li>
    <li><strong>Replies (40%):</strong> Thoughtful engagement with classmates' experiences and tips</li>
