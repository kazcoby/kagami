  <h1>Discussion: Share Your Home Discovery</h1>

  <div class="discussion-prompt">
    <h2>Discussion Prompt</h2>
    <p>This week, you explored your home to locate its essential systems—water shutoffs, electrical panel, smoke detectors, and more. Now it's time to share what you discovered!</p>

    <p><strong>In your initial post, answer the following:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>The biggest surprise:</strong> What did you find that you didn't expect, or what was harder to locate than you anticipated?</li>
      <li><strong>Your comfort level:</strong> Before this module, on a scale of 1-10, how confident were you in handling a home emergency? How about now?</li>
      <li><strong>One thing you'll do differently:</strong> Based on what you learned, what's one change you'll make or one thing you'll keep in mind going forward?</li>
      <li><strong>Renter or homeowner insight:</strong> Share one thing specific to your situation (renter or homeowner) that you learned this week.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="requirements">
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial post:</strong> 150-250 words, due by Day 4</li>
      <li><strong>Replies:</strong> Respond meaningfully to at least 2 classmates, due by Day 7</li>
      <li><strong>Meaningful replies</strong> share your own experience, offer a tip, or ask a follow-up question—not just "Great post!"</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Discussion Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be specific—"I found my water shutoff behind the water heater" is more helpful than "I found it"</li>
    <li>It's okay to admit you couldn't find something—your classmates might have tips!</li>
    <li>Share photos if you're comfortable (but be mindful of privacy)</li>
    <li>Be encouraging—we're all learning together</li>
    <li>If you discover something concerning (like missing smoke detectors), share how you plan to address it</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial post (60%):</strong> Addresses all prompts, demonstrates engagement with the material</li>
    <li><strong>Replies (40%):</strong> Thoughtful engagement with classmates' experiences</li>
  </ul>
