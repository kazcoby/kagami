  <h2>Discussion Prompt</h2>

  <div class="prompt-box">
    <p>Congratulations! You've made it through all four modules of the course. This final discussion is a celebration of what you've learned and a chance to share your experiences with your classmates.</p>

    <p><strong>Part 1: Your DIY Victory (or Lesson Learned)</strong></p>
    <p>Share a home maintenance or repair task you attempted during this course (or recently). This could be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A squeaky hinge you silenced</li>
      <li>A toilet you diagnosed or fixed</li>
      <li>Caulk you replaced</li>
      <li>A filter you changed</li>
      <li>A leak you found and addressed</li>
      <li>A GFCI you tested and reset</li>
      <li>A wall hole you patched</li>
      <li>Or ANY home maintenance task!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tell us:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What was the task?</li>
      <li>How did it go? (Success, partial success, or learning experience)</li>
      <li>What would you do differently next time?</li>
      <li>Would you tackle a similar task again? Why or why not?</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Part 2: Your Maintenance Plan</strong></p>
    <p>Share your plan for staying on top of home maintenance going forward:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What system will you use? (Calendar, app, paper checklist?)</li>
      <li>Which monthly tasks are most important for YOUR home?</li>
      <li>Is there anything you learned that you'll definitely put into practice?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Part 3: Pay It Forward</strong></p>
    <p>Share ONE tip you'd give to someone just starting to learn about home maintenance. What's the most valuable thing you learned that you wish you'd known sooner?</p>
